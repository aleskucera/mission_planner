## Usage

### Install the dependencies

We recommend using a virtual environment or conda environment to manage dependencies.

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run the application

To locally run the application, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python app.py
```

To connect to the application, open your web browser and navigate to: `http://localhost:5000` if you did not change the default port. If you encounter any issues, check the terminal for the provided URL.
